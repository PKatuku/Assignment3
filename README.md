I have created a Food Ordering app via SMS To use this app you have to download the code and unzip it and then with the help of VSCode you can run the code To run:

The first time run npm install Press ctrl-f5 while your focus is in one of the files that starts with a number and is all lower case. You can Order the Food by sending a message and there will be a prompt with saying Welcome In the next step you'll recieve some options of Food You'd like At the end you'll recieve the total Order placed and The total amount of Order with taxes and the Delivery Details will be displayed.
Now you'll get a Payment Link, where you can click the link which will redirect to your Paypal account
